# Introduction

For this task, I have used 3 data sets on halloween candy ratings, gathered 
using a survey. 

Each data set includes answers to a set of personal questions,
such as age, gender, country etc. The next part of the survey asks people to 
rate halloween candy, using ratings "JOY", "MEH" and "DESPAIR". Lastly there are 
a final set of columns with additional comments, ratings etc.

The 3 data sets represent candy ratings from 3 different years - 2015, 2016
and 2017.

A few things to note:

* There are types of candy that do not appear in every data set.

* 2015 data does not include gender or location.

# Assumptions

Age cannot be higher than 125 years.

# Cleaning Process

The first thing I did was clean column names using the janitor package. Then, I 
dropped the columns at the end of each data set that included extra comments and
unrelated ratings and questions.

I then removed all columns from the data that I did not need for my analysis.
These included the columns timestamp and state/province, as well as things such 
as medicine, money, DVDs and other foods that are not candy.

I added a year column for each of the data sets, so as to not lose that data 
once combined.

I joined the data sets using `bind_rows()` and then cleaned up columns gender,
age and country.

```{r}
all_candy_data_fix_gender <- all_candy_data_fix_going_out %>% 
  mutate(gender = na_if(gender, "I'd rather not say"))
```

```{r}
all_candy_data_fix_age <- all_candy_data_fix_gender %>% 
  mutate(age = as.numeric(age),
         age = if_else(age > 125,
                       NaN,
                       age))
```

For the country column, I used `case_when()` to turn all invalid answers to NAs
and `str_replace()` to fix typos etc.

Finally, I pivoted the tibble into a long format. 

```{r}
all_candy_data_pivoted <- all_candy_data_fix_country %>% 
  pivot_longer(x100_grand_bar:peanut_butter_bars,
               names_to = "candy_name", 
               values_to = "rating")
```
